# Bike-Share Demand Prediction Project Proposal

## Project Description

This project aims to build a predictive model for bike-share usage by integrating historical Bluebikes trip data with weather information. We will use Python to develop a full data pipeline—from data ingestion and cleaning through feature engineering, exploratory analysis, and modeling—to forecast bike-share demand. By merging Bluebikes trip history data (available at [Hubway Data](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hubway-data/index.html)) with weather data obtained via the [OpenWeatherMap One Call 3 API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-3), our goal is to understand how weather conditions and temporal factors influence bike usage and to develop a robust, reproducible prediction system.

## Project Goals

- **Primary Goal:**  
  Accurately predict bike-share demand (i.e., the number of trips or bike rentals) based on weather conditions, time of day, and other contextual features using a Python-based modeling approach.

- **Secondary Goals:**  
  - Analyze the influence of external factors—such as temperature, precipitation, and wind speed—on bike-share usage.
  - Build a reproducible data pipeline that automates data collection, cleaning, feature extraction, visualization, and model training.
  - Compare multiple regression and ensemble models (e.g., linear regression, random forests, gradient boosting) to evaluate their performance.
  - Implement unit tests and continuous integration using GitHub Actions to ensure code quality and reproducibility.

## Data Collection

- **Bluebikes Trip History Data:**  
  - **Source:** Bluebikes (formerly Hubway) trip history data is available at [Hubway Data](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hubway-data/index.html).  
  - **Method:** Download the historical trip data files (typically in CSV format) which include trip start and end times, station IDs, and user information.

- **Weather Data:**  
  - **Source:** OpenWeatherMap One Call 3 API ([https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-3](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-3)).  
  - **Method:** Use Python’s HTTP libraries (e.g., `requests`) to query the One Call 3 API for historical weather conditions (such as temperature, precipitation, wind speed, etc.) corresponding to the dates and times in the Bluebikes dataset.

## Data Cleaning and Feature Extraction

- **Data Cleaning:**  
  - Use Python’s **pandas** library to load, inspect, and clean both datasets.  
  - Parse and standardize timestamp fields, align trip data with corresponding weather observations, and handle missing or inconsistent values.

- **Feature Extraction:**  
  - Derive time-based features (hour, day of week, month, holiday flag) from the Bluebikes trip timestamps.  
  - Extract relevant weather features (temperature, precipitation, wind speed, humidity, etc.) from the OpenWeatherMap API responses.  
  - Engineer additional features, such as moving averages or interaction terms between weather and time, to capture seasonal and daily patterns.

## Modeling Approach

- **Techniques:**  
  - Begin with baseline models using linear regression to set a performance benchmark.
  - Explore more advanced ensemble methods like random forests and gradient boosting (using libraries such as scikit-learn, XGBoost, or LightGBM) to capture non-linear relationships.
  - Evaluate model performance using regression metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

- **Data Splitting:**  
  - Use a temporal split—training on data from the earlier months and testing on the most recent period—to mimic a real-world forecasting scenario.
  - Optionally implement time series cross-validation strategies to ensure robustness.

## Data Visualization

- **Exploratory Analysis:**  
  - Use **Matplotlib** and **Plotly** to create time series plots of bike usage alongside weather trends.
  - Generate scatter plots, heatmaps, and correlation matrices to examine relationships between trip counts and features.
  - Consider interactive dashboards with Plotly if dynamic exploration is needed.

## Testing and Reproducibility

- **Unit and Integration Tests:**  
  - Write unit tests (using pytest, for example) for critical data processing and feature extraction functions.
  - Set up a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically run tests on each commit

- **Reproducibility:**  
  - Document all dependencies in a `requirements.txt` or Conda environment file.
  - Use Git for version control and consider containerizing the project with Docker to ensure consistency across environments.

## Timeline and Scope

- **Duration:** Two months  
- **Milestones:**  
  - **Weeks 1–2:** Collect and clean the Bluebikes trip history and weather data.  
  - **Weeks 3–4:** Engineer features and conduct exploratory data analysis; create initial visualizations.  
  - **Weeks 5–6:** Develop and experiment with baseline and advanced predictive models.  
  - **Week 7-8:** Documentation, Final refinements, evaluation, and preparation for project submission.
